                                <p>Possibly the person with the most potential we have found in Start UC3M. Brilliant student who seeks to grow and improve as a person and professional every day. He has taken advantage of every opportunity he has had to show that he is ahead of his age group with self-confidence, enthusiasm and a lot of responsibility. She has everything to become whatever she wants.</p>

                                <p>You are an example of perseverance and humility. At Start UC3M we believe in meritocracy and that you can learn by doing. She has taken advantage of all the opportunities she has been given to keep advancing and improving. Age should never be a problem for anyone to advance in their career and I hope that she is not hindered by that nonsense, as she is much more responsible, organized and mature than many people her age.</p>
