                <p>Tabty is a team project developed for the Product Studio course at Cornell Tech. Our international team consisted of one MBA student, three Computer Science Master's students, and myself; we collaborated closely with Tata Consulting.</p>            
                <p>The project began with the prompt: "How Might We create digital biomarkers to better detect the early onset of neurodegenerative diseases?" Extensive research led us to focus specifically on Parkinson's Disease. We developed a keyboard supported by a machine learning algorithm that predicted Parkinson's Disease cases with over 98% confidence, based on the time users took to press and release each key while typing. To enhance the user experience, this keyboard was integrated into a mobile app featuring a series of interactive games.</p>
