                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>For years, Netflix has been the streaming content platform with the greatest quantity and variety worldwide, and the one that produces the most series and movies. This means that its catalog has grown over the years, as has the user's difficulty in choosing what to watch, reaching an average of 14 minutes. In turn, this has led to an increase in the platform's abandonment rate.</p>
                            <p>Instituto Tramontana tasked us with addressing this issue through a <strong>research-focused approach</strong> rather than immediate execution. The proposed solution involved conducting user interviews —with their careful preparation (objectives, hypotheses, target users, interview guide...)—, and the subsequente analysis of the information through categorization and learning and insight extraction to inform design decisions.</p>
                            <p>The Researh process consisted on two phases:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Exploratory Phase (in-depth interviews):</strong> Get to know our challenge's context, a better understanding of the user's conduct and discover their needs, motivations and experiences.</li>
                                <li><strong>Evaluative Phase (proof of concept):</strong> Evaluate the perceived relevance, interest and utility of an idea of product, feature or service.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                            <p class="faded"><strong>Secondary Research</strong></p>
                            <p>Netflix has experienced a decrease in the number of users for the first time in their history, a share that has been absorbed by the competence.</p>
                            <p>According to many psychological analyses, the reasons behind users not wanting to make decisions are fear to making mistakes, opportunity costs, lack of self-confidence. People tend to prefer to have the decision made by external factors in order to avoid being responsible for it.</p>

                            <p>Netflix Community is a social feature that allows you to add your friends in Netflix, recommend the content you have enjoyed and see what your friends are recommending. This way, you have a resource to choose what to watch in a faster and easier way.</p>
                            <p>The new feature must be seamlessly integrated into such a well-known branding, while also creating strategies for user adoption.</p>
                            <p>In order to balance that identification and integration, we are using a blue tone that Netflix already played with for a couple of actions. In terms of adoption, we added a banner into the homepage. The header menu includes the Community section, and in your profile, you are able to modify your recommendations.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Netflix has already been experimenting with it, but without a concrete use going further than a “watch more” tertiary button.</li>
                            <li>It mixes an matches well with tha classic Netflix red tone.</li>
                            <li>It is noticeable, but not alarming. Blue is informative, neutral.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div>
                            <p>Máximo Gavete, Spanish designer and author of the newsletter Honos, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/honosbyomixam/p/honos-151-disenar-el-entre?r=38w34&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email" target="_blank">once expressed</a> that design has been so obsessed with functionalism for so long that we have forgotten to focus on relationships. As the author himself says, "we need a design that relates to us from the affective, not from functionality". A design that goes beyond the solution to a problem, that does not focus on the what or the who, but on the between.</p>
                            <p>After several weeks of research, interviews and iterations, the Netflix Community was born. <strong>A space to share content recommendations with your acquaintances. A social component, an indirect conversation and a link in the distance.</strong> In other words, <em>"a between"</em>.</p>
