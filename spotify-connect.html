            <p>My approach to design—particularly in UX, which is one of my strengths—is to thoroughly analyze and understand the interplay between users, the context of use, the device, and the interface in creating digital products and services. Rushing into production is a common pitfall in UX.</p>            
            <p>One of my projects at Instituto Tramontana was Spotify Connect. We were challenged with the following problem: "Listening to Spotify in the shower is very uncomfortable. Can you think of a way to solve this?"</p>
            <p>Starting from scratch while maintaining Spotify's brand image, I began addressing the unknowns. Does it require a screen? What materials could prevent tarnishing? How will users interact with it if their hands are wet or their eyes are covered in soap? The outcome was Spotify Connect, a waterproof, easy-to-use device that ensures Spotify can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere.</p>
